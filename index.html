    <h1>Hello CodeWorks</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Rachel Mason</strong></p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. Here in Boise I have a tight knit community of friends and a dog that takes up most of my free time. I just graduated from Boise State University with a Marketing degree. I would like to work in digital marketing in the future. I am working with Boise CodeWorks to develop the skills needed to suceed in the field.</p>
